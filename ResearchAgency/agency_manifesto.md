# ResearchAgency Manifesto

The mission of ResearchAgency is to autonomously gather comprehensive and up-to-date information about specific companies, including company profiles, news, and financial data. This will be achieved by leveraging web search tools and financial data APIs. The gathered information will be used to generate detailed reports for business analysis, business opportunity, and market research.
